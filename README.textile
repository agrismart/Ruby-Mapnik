h1. This is what you all have been waiting for: RUBY BINDINGS FOR MAPNIK

Soon all of your mapping will be like pouding ch√¥meur!

h2. Requirements
* Mapnik2 (aka the trunk available here: http://svn.mapnik.org/trunk)
* Ruby 1.8.7
* These rubygems:
** ZenTest 4.0.0
** rice 1.4.2
** hoe 2.10.0
** rake-compiler 0.7.9

h2. Building

Compile and install Mapnik2 so it is linkable as mapnik2. Install and update the 
headers so statements like @#include <mapnik2/box2d.hpp>@ work properly.

You can then use @rake compile@ to build the extension, and @rake test@ to run the
unit tests. @rake clean@ will do what you think it does, and you can stack up
rake tasks so @rake clean compile test@ might be a nice thing to keep around.

h2. Development

Obviously this is under development, and nowhere close to being complete, or 
really useful at the moment. Help would be greatly appreciated, providing 
the extension will always compile, and all changes are accompanied by unit 
tests.

Autotest works great with this code base with this in your .autotest: 
@Autotest.add_hook :run_command {|at|system "rake compile"}@
